# Get Started

- Created makefile to try to automate the stages execution 
- Had to setup my environment via commands in target `eneko-setup`

## Adding Explorer tests 

- Added [explorer page](pages/explorer_page.py)
- Added [explorer test](test_weave_gitops_enterprise/explorer)

The following scenarios will be executed:

1. Objective 2: I should see applications in explorer
2. Objective 3: results are complete and consistent
3. Objective 4a: information is realtime for new data
4. Objective 4b: information is realtime for updated data

### Objective 2: I should see applications in explorer 




## Summary

### Potential Improvements 

- could be useful get started with dependency setup
- could be useful to add a contributing guide with 
  - how to do a good acceptance test and not 
  - where to place them in terms of code ownership - by feature, by team, etc 
  - how is it maintained
